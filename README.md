This is MelodyStream! An way to listen to music designed by me and made with HTML, Javascript and css and a little python code which was made to semplify the creation of arrays to implement in the javascript code
As it's clear in the page's popup, all the songs in this folders are copytight free, and that's why all the songs are remixed.
Everyone is free to delete the songs and add their own.
It is possible to:
- Select the loop mode
- Select the casual mode
- Modify the queue
- Adjust the volume
- Search for songs
- Pause the songs
- Skip the songs
This was my project.
